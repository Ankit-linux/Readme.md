|`8`|**Incident Analysis & Resolution** | When I shifted to a new room, no tube light were burning in that room. Then I checked by putting new tube light in the tube light  holder. Still the tube light was not burning. Then I call the electrician and when the electrician checked the tube light, he said that your tubelight chock is not work. Then I brought a new tube light chock. Then I checked the tube light, then my problem was solved.|
